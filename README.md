# NetCDF data extractor
NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a file format for storing multidimensional scientific data (variables) such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and direction.
This python file contains the necessary functions to extract data from a netCDF file.
It will create a time series plot and output data in a CSV file. In addition, metadata attributes also can be visualized for the file.  
  
  
input: NetCDF, day, lat, long   
output: TS plot and CSV

Panoply desktop software works best for quick views and creating animation using NetCDF files. Python packages, xarray, and NetCDF4 work best for modeling and production environments.
