# NetCDF data extractor
NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a file format for storing multidimensional scientific data (variables) such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and direction.

### ncArea_extract
NetCDF data file management  
This notebook is beginner-friendly and suitable for a range of use cases in modeling data preparation  

This notebook aims following tasks ü•Ö
- [ ] reading the NetCDF file
- [ ] extracting attributes
- [ ] extracting physical values as arrays
- [ ] display as images
- [ ] display in automatically adjusting frames
- [ ] extract by data range / give area AOI (shapefile)
- [ ] save png images / create gif animations
- [ ] convert into geotiff, so that work easilly with rasterio/GDAL/QGIS/ENVI  
This notebook contains functionality for extracting data from NetCDF files for an area of interest (AOI) and converting them to the text data format for use by grid-based ecosystem models.  
Use case scenario; Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator uses grid-based bin data sets as input weather data files. This code will create data set for a given resolution to match the spatial resolution of the satellite sensor ‚úîÔ∏è

### 
This python file contains the necessary functions to extract data from a netCDF file.
It will create a time series plot and output data in a CSV file. In addition, metadata attributes also can be visualized for the file.  
  
  
input: NetCDF, day, lat, long   
output: TS plot and CSV
